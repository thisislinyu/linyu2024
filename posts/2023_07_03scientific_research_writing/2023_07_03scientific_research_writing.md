## Introduction

### Tense pairs

Present Simple versus Past Simple

- **Present simple**: describe facts
- **Past simple**: describe findings relating to your own reserach
  - For example, we found that the CHD risk **increased** as individuals got older.

Present simple sounds stronger than past simple.

Past Simple versus Present Perfect
- **Past simple**: describe what happened in the past (a snapshot)
- **Present perfect**: describe what happened in the past and the continuing effect
  - Little (virtually none) attention **was paid** to this issue (sentence 1)
  - Little  attention **has been paid** to this issue (sentence 2)

>Sentence 1 means attension was not paid at some point in the past, and that's it. the issue may has been solved. Sentence 2 emphasizes this issue has not been paied attention to from the past till now.

### Sentence connection

Several strategies to glue sentences together
- overlap: repeat things
  - The pattern of inflammation during an asthma attack is different from that seen in **stable asthma**. In **stable asthma** the total number of inflammatory cells does not increase.
- pronouns (it, they), pro-form (this system, these methods)
- semicolon (Joining sentences with a semicolon works well when two sentences are very closely related and one of them is quite short), or relative clause(which clause)
  - The procedure for testing whether components are operationally safe usually takes many hours **;** this means that tests are rarely repeated.
  - It has received much attention over the past few decades due to its biodegradable properties, **which** off er important economic benefits.
- sentence connector signals: however, therefore, etc.
  - **Cause**ï¼š Due to (the fact that); on account of (the fact that); in view of (the fact that); as; because; since.
  - **Result**: Therefore; Consequently; Hence; As a result (of which); which is why; so.
  - **Contrast/Difference**: However; whereas; but; on the other hand; while; by contrast.
_Note: on the contrary and conversely communicate the fact that exactly the opposite is true. not applicable in some circumstance_
  - **Unexpectedness**: Although; even though; though; despite; in spite of; regardless of; notwithstanding; nevertheless; however; yet; nonetheless; even so.
  - **Addition**: in addiction; moreover; furthermore; apart from that/which; also; secondly; in the second place; what is more.
_Note:besides sounds more powerful and is better used in more persuasive contexts_

### Passive versus Active

Summary: In the introduction part, use **we** to represent your research group (but do not use we to represent people in general, use it is known/thought that...). It is more common to use passive tense in the report session (i.e., methodology and result parts). For a thesis, where you did the work on your own, it is common to use 'dummy' subject to take the place of I or we (this article describes/the present paper/in this study)


### Paragraghing
Quickly look at the first sentence of each paragraph.
- Establish the significance of your research topic (tense: present perfect or past simple).
  - PLA has received much attention in recent years due to its biodegradable properties
- Provide background facts 1-2 sentences.
- Introduce general problem/ **current research focus** (many researchers in this field are interested in).
- Current solutions to the problem (transition sentence to literature review)
- Describe overview of projects in this field aiming to solve this problem, remember, order matters.
  - chronological
  - differenet approaches/theories/models
  - general/specific
- Describe research gap (however, although...), or bring up your hypothesis
- Describe your work.
  - Use **present simple** to describe the work itself. E.g., this paper is organised as follows, or this study focuses on blabal
  - Use **past simple** to talk about the aim of the study. (as the aim occurred before the work was carried out).
  - If the aim is only partially achieved, you can then use **present simple**(the aim of this work is ...), indicating the rest of the work will be done and reported on at a later stage.
  - Give details about the methodology.
  - Report findings.

## Methodology

Different title names: Procedure, Experiments, Experimental, Simulation, Methodology or Model depending on the disciplines (you can read the guidelines for a journal)

### Passives

- **Passive/Active**: You can use **active** if you worked as part of a research team. But for thesis writing, where you did the work alone, it is not normal to wirte **I** collected. In this case, use XX is/was (present/past simple passive) collected instead; or you can use dummy subject, **in this study, data was collected**, to indicate what you have done.
- **Present Simple/Past Simple**: 
  - describe what is normally done(standard procedure): present simple, data is collected (remember to add reference)
  - describe what you have actually done: past simple, data was collected
  - describe what is done by other researchers: past simple, in their work, they collected...

### Use of 'a' and 'the'

I had **a** cheese sandwich and **an** apple for lunch. **The** sandwich was fine but **the** apple had **a** worm in it.

- **a**: introduce new things to listener.
- **the**: both the speaker and listener know what the speaker refers to.

Other examples,

I arrived at Heathrow Airport but **the** check-in was closed
I bought a new computer but **the** keyboard was faulty

- Though check-in and keyboard appear first time in this sentence, as soon as Heathrow Airport and computer are mentioned, both speaker and listener share the information.

Principles:
- Use **The** if there is only one possible referent.
  - Cairo is the capital of Egypt.
- Use **a** if it does not matter or you do not know or your reader do not know which thing/person you are referring to.
  - A 35 ml brown glass bottle was used to store the liquid.
- a, the, two can all be used generically when expressing a general truth.
  - The electroencephalograph is a machine for measuring brain waves.
  - An electroencephalograph is a machine for measuring brain waves.
  - Electroencephalograph are machines for measuring brain waves.

### Adverbs and adverb location

### general steps
- One sentence to summarize your methodology
- Describe your method in detail and **justify** why this particular method is applied
- If you are not sure how much details should be provided, give too much info is better than to little.
- Indicate the method is conducted **with care**
- Indicate where problems occurred
