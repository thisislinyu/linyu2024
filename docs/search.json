    "text": "Summary of this project\nBackground: Cancer survival analysis often confronts high-dimensional data. To allow the implementation of classical statistical modelling such as Cox regression in such setting, feature selection (FS) is commonly conducted before statistical modelling. However, existing algorithms do not often consider the interaction term and ignore the statistical significance of it, even though the interactive effect is of clinical interest in helping understand the complex relationships among variables and reveal potential heterogenous effect among individuals.\nObjectives: This study aimed to develop high-dimensional feature selection with interactions (HDSI) algorithms for time-to-event outcome that incorporates interactions in the high dimensional setting.\nMethods: Two algorithms, HDSI-LASSO and HDSI-Ridge were developed by incorporating Cox-LASSO and Cox-Ridge into the HDSI framework. Bootstrap resampling algorithm was developed by incorporating the two-way interaction terms into the model, FS criteria were determined based on pooled significance and model performance of each feature. The performances of the proposed algorithm were evaluated in simulation studies and implemented into a real-world dataset.\nResults: In the simulations, the HDSI-LASSO and HDSI-Ridge, on average, selected 3 out of 5 true marginal effects, and 1 out of 2 true interactive features. In the real-world study, HDSI- LASSO and HDSI-Ridge selected 7 and 66 out of 4950 interaction terms, respectively. Both algorithms showed good performance by selecting very few noisy features.\nConclusions: The proposed HDSI algorithms show potential in identifying interactive effects, which consequently, increase the model performance. The HDSI-LASSO offers more robust performance regarding changes in the number of features, while HDSI-Ridge is preferable for lower dimension settings."

    "text": "cheatsheet\n\nRate is not a probability\n\nmodel time? e.g., log T = Z/linear predictor –&gt; censoring/ missing data problem. the out come time-to-event is not always observed due to censoring/competing risk.\n\nModel rate: the aggregated data: known the total number of years and the total number of events\n\n\nwhy rate works? the rate param captures the instantaneous occurrence of the outcome at any given time.（count of success = 每个瞬时时间点上的发生数量，乘上观测总时间）\nwhile risk param is the probability of an event occurring within a specific time period.\n\nrisk-rate connection:\nIn probability theory and statistics, the Poisson distribution is a discrete probability distribution that expresses the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time if these events occur with a known constant mean rate(?) and independently of the time since the last event.\n\n\n\nPoisson model\n\n\n\nThe likelihood: D ~ Poisson(lambda*Y), where log(lambda) = something (the log-linear model), then parametrize log(lambda) in terms of alpha and beta. substitute the model into the PDF to get the likelihood.\n\n\n2024-06-09更新\n\n\n傻傻分不清到底哪个是constant –&gt; rate is constant（instantaneous occurrence of the outcome at any given time). 我们把总时间Y划分为N个小bin，每个小bin为一个单位unit h, that is, Y = Nh. h足够小的时候，每一个小bin只有一个事件发生，则每个小bin都是一个Bern(pi),–&gt; 每个小bin的expected number = pi(Bern dist property). mu = pi(risk) (1),\n\n在pois dist,我们有 mu = lambda(rate)*h(2)\n\n这样结合(1)和 (2)，我们有了rate-risk connection: mu = pi(risk)=lambda(rate)h\n然后我们就可以算survival probability啦：survival up to time T = (1 - risk)^N [T时间内一共有N个bin]= (1-lambda*h)^N –&gt; approx. exp(-lambda*T)其中，lambda*T 是cumulative hazard. surv prob(T) = (1-lambda*h)^N = Aexp(-lambda*T)\n\n\n\nWrite the likelihood\n\n写likelihood的时候，我们的结局变量outcome包含了 event status and time, 所以我们写的是每个人的一个joint pdf: prob of (event happened/censored at time t)，并且是marginal的，并不是conditional。\nRV 有哪些呢： (i)censoring dist; (2) latent event time dist;\n但是我们的数据是observed data, 我们的模型是wrt latent event time的， 所以我们需要一些假设们来得到一些identification.\n(A1): indep censoring :censoring time and latent event time indep given covariates\n(A2)：non-informative censoring: censoring not involve theta(param of interest)，所以在likelihood里面可以把它当作constant，不用放进likelihood里边\n写出general case的likelihood之后呢，可以看到需要代入 lambda(t) (hazard rate) 和survival function(t), 这就非常的简单～～以pois为例子：lambda(t) = lambda（constant）； S(t) 和 hazard function 是有一个公式联系起来的，S(T) = exp(-lambda(t)*T).带进去就行。\n\nconstant hazard model写likelihood可以用几种方式来写，可见cheatsheet\n\n\nimmortal time bias\nimmortal time bias\n\n\nKM survival curve calculation\n一生总要计算一次的KM curve重要总结：\n#1: 先写表格： 1)表格第一列为时间段，左闭右开，每个time interval 的下界为事件发生的时间点们，比如对于control arm，在observed time= 1.5的时候就没有事件发生，survival curve不会下降，就没有必要写time interval [1.25,1.5)，而是直接写[1.25,2)，左闭右开可以这样理解，比如treatment arm的第一个death发生在observed time=1， time interval则是[0,1),在这个区间里，我们依然认为这个人是at-risk,另外还有一种情况是有人在observed time = 1的时候删失了，那这个人还是at-risk,因为我们的区间是不包含1的，至少在time=1之前这个人是at-risk 所以用这样的区间就比较直观; 2) 然后censor(c)，deathD(d)，at-risk(r)人数，1-d/r, survival则可以计算为(1-d/r)的累乘\n#2: 然后是画图，我们可以把删失用+号表示\n#3: 找risk set的以后，我们也可以通过在follow up图上画一个vertical line,交点的个数就是# of pts at-risk at time t.\n\n\nHomework sets\n\nHW1\nHW2\nHW3\nHW4"
